#LLM hashtag#Hallucinations in Long Documents: The Multi-Million Dollar Problem in hashtag#EnterpriseAI

Extensive research across healthcare, finance, and legal sectors reveals that LLM hallucination rates exceed 75% in long document processing, with accuracy plummeting to below 60% toward response conclusions.

The "hallucinate at the last" phenomenon affects all major models—hashtag#GPT-4, hashtag#Claude, hashtag#LLaMA and others. It stems from six fundamental architectural limitations:

- Attention drift (models focus 4x more on their own output than source material.)
- Memory constraints (32K contexts require 156GB memory)
- Positional bias (the "lost-in-the-middle" problem)
- Cascade error propagation (2.3x error amplification)
- Context degradation (reference accuracy drops from 82% to 29%)
- Computational complexity scaling (O(n²) bottlenecks)

The solution framework mentioned in this hashtag#Medium post combines intelligent hashtag#chunking algorithms, retrieval augmented generation (hashtag#RAG), and memory-efficient architectures to address these fundamental limitations. Suggested strategies are proven to reduce errors, leading to significant decreases in mistakes while maintaining processing speed, which gives clear benefits in areas where accuracy is crucial, like analysing legal documents, handling medical records, and ensuring financial compliance.
