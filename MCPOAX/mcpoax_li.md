Take a note of the AI integration crossroads. Enhancing existing standards could be more efficient route to take, than building new protocols.

As #AI agents increasingly integrate with programmatic access to business workflows, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as one approach to bridge the gap between traditional APIs and agent-centric interfaces. However, the same semantic richness that #MCP provides might be achievable through OpenAPI's proven extensibility mechanisms.

Instead of replacing established standards, what if #OpenAPI vendor extension system (`x-ai-*` fields) evolved instead to deliver equivalent agent-aware capabilities while preserving existing infrastructure investments. Microsoft Semantic Kernel and IBM Research have already proven this approach works in production.

The question is not if innovations of the #ModelContextProtocol are valuable. It is whether protocol replacement or standards enhancement better achieves these goals. Sometimes the best path forward is not starting fresh, but building thoughtfully on solid foundations.
