# Options trading thumb rules

## Classify moneyness
- **Calls:** ITM if strike < spot; ATM ≈ spot; OTM > spot.
- **Puts:** ITM if strike > spot; ATM ≈ spot; OTM < spot.

## Strike selection
- **Default:** ATM or slightly ITM for higher win probability.
- Use slightly OTM only with strong conviction of a quick, large move.

## Use OI and liquidity
- Prefer strikes with high OI and tight spreads.
- **Calls:** heavy call OI above spot = resistance; Puts: heavy put OI below spot = support.
    - If OI is evenly spread, skip—no edge.

## Avoid chasing big premium spikes
- If same-day premium change >15%, avoid chasing; wait for a dip/pullback.
- **Exception:** strong breakout with volume and market breadth; still size smaller.

## Entry price rules (premium-based)
- After a big up day (≥25% premium jump), aim to buy on a pullback:
- Target the lower third to mid-range of the prior day’s premium range, or
- A 25–40% retracement from that day’s high to low, or
- A retest of intraday demand/support on the option chart.
- Practical guide: If day range was L–H and close is near the top, look to enter around L + 35–50% of (H–L).
- Never enter at/near the session high unless you accept tighter SL and smaller size.

## Stop loss rules (premium-based)
- Set SL at 25–30% below your entry premium OR just below the nearest intraday support on the option chart—whichever is tighter.
- If you entered high (after a spike), tighten SL to 20–25%.
- Reassess/exit if the underlying loses the nearby structure (for calls: fails at resistance; for puts: holds support).

## Target rules (premium-based)
- Short-dated ATM/near-ATM (1–3 weeks to expiry):
- Base target = +33–50% above entry premium.
- **Scale out:** book partials near prior premium high; hold runner toward the +50% zone if underlying breaks key level with momentum.
- If IV is likely to contract (post-event), prefer the lower end of the target band.

## Position correlation control
- Avoid stacking trades with the same sector/index driver or the same direction. Diversify exposures.

## Hedge when uncertainty is high
- Ahead of events or in choppy conditions, pair with a small opposite-side option to cap tail risk.

## Skip when no edge
- If trend unclear, OI dispersed, or premiums overstretched without structure—stand aside.

## Monitor and manage on premium and price
- Track both underlying levels and option premium behavior (IV, theta). Trail stops on the premium after +25–30% move in your favor.

## Quick example (buying a call)
- **Prior day premium range:** ₹8–₹12.6, close ₹10.1 (+50%).
- **Entry:** wait for ₹8.7–₹9.3 pullback (mid/lower-range or demand retest).
- **SL:** 25–30% below entry → from ₹9.0, SL ₹6.3–₹6.8 → use ₹6.5.
- **Target:** +33–50% from ₹9.0 → ₹12.0–₹13.5 for partials; ₹14–₹16 on breakout continuation.
